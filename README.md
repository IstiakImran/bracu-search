## Introduction
The **Bracu Search** is a web-based application designed to provide real-time information about the availability of rooms within Brac University's Mohakhali campus. With the fast-paced nature of campus life, finding an available room for group discussions, self-study, or meetings can be a challenging task. Our project aims to simplify this process by offering an intuitive and up-to-date platform that displays the occupancy status of various rooms on campus.
